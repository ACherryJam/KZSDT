# KZSDT - Katana Zero Shadow Die Twice
(actually, it's just enemies with 2 hp, but you get it)

This mod adds a shield to all non-boss enemies, making you hit them twice
Simple concept. Not so simple challenge.

## How to install/uninstall
- Add/remove `dbghelp.dll` file to your Katana ZERO folder
- Enjoy!

Shoutouts to nkrapivin for teaching me the ropes of Ghidra and GML decompilation over two years, without him I wouldn't be able to make this

GameMaker structures were yoinked from nik's [libLassebq](https://github.com/nkrapivin/libLassebq) or/and [modshovel](https://github.com/nkrapivin/modshovel). Don't remember.
